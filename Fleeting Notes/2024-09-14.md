### Some Checks Before Accepting Jobs
10 Things to Check Before Accepting an Offer Letter  
  
1. üí∞ Salary Package ‚Äì Is the offer aligning with industry standards and your expectations? Don't settle for less.  
  
2. üìÖ Work Hours ‚Äì Check if the company expects you to work beyond regular hours. Is there flexibility, or are you chained to the desk?  
  
3. üè• Benefits & Perks ‚Äì Health insurance, bonuses, paid leave‚Äîensure the full benefits package meets your needs.  
  
4. üíº Job Role & Responsibilities ‚Äì Are the job duties clearly defined? If it's vague, it could mean doing way more than you signed up for.  
  
5. üöÄ Career Growth ‚Äì Is there room for growth? Look for training opportunities, promotions, or leadership roles.  
  
6. üè¢ Company Culture ‚Äì A toxic workplace can ruin even a dream job. Research the work environment to ensure it‚Äôs a good fit.  
  
7. üó£Ô∏è Team & Leadership ‚Äì Have you met your potential boss or teammates? Bad management or toxic colleagues could make your life hell.  
  
8. üö™ Exit Policy ‚Äì What‚Äôs the notice period? Some companies have ridiculous exit terms, so be sure you won‚Äôt get trapped.  
  
9. üìç Location/Remote Work ‚Äì Consider the commute or if the remote work options suit your lifestyle. Long commutes can drain your energy.  
  
10. üßæ Job Stability ‚Äì Is the company financially stable? If they‚Äôre laying off people or just starting up, tread carefully. You don't want to be looking for another job in six months.
