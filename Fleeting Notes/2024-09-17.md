### Why we Failed
1. Perfectionism:  
“One of my biggest weaknesses is that I can be a bit of a perfectionist. I tend to spend extra time ensuring every detail is just right, which can sometimes slow me down. However, I’ve learned to balance this by setting realistic deadlines for myself and prioritizing tasks that truly require meticulous attention.”  
  
2. Difficulty Delegating:  
“I sometimes struggle with delegating tasks because I’m very hands-on and want to ensure everything is done correctly. However, I’ve been working on this by building trust in my team’s abilities and learning that delegation is essential for efficiency and team growth.”  
  
3. Impatience:  
“I can be a bit impatient when projects are not moving as quickly as I’d like. This is because I’m very results-driven and like to see progress. However, I’ve been focusing on improving my patience by understanding the value of the process and recognizing that not all tasks need to be rushed.”  
  
4. Public Speaking:  
“I used to struggle with public speaking, which made me nervous in front of large groups. To overcome this, I started volunteering to lead smaller meetings and took a public speaking course. While I still get a bit nervous, I’ve become much more confident and effective in communicating with larger audiences.”  
  
5. Overcommitment:  
“I have a tendency to overcommit myself because I’m eager to help out and be involved in multiple projects. This sometimes leads to a packed schedule. I’m working on this by learning to assess my capacity more realistically and saying no when necessary, to ensure I can focus on delivering quality work.”
